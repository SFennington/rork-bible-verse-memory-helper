CHAPTER LOADING DEBUG SYSTEM - QUICK START
===========================================

I've added comprehensive logging to help us find exactly why chapters aren't 
showing up in "My Progress". This is a systematic approach that will tell us 
exactly where the problem is occurring.

WHAT I DID:
-----------
1. Added detailed console.log statements throughout the code that handles:
   - Adding chapters to progress
   - Displaying chapters in the progress list
   - Finding chapters in the app's state

2. Created helper scripts:
   - view-logs.ps1: View app logs in real-time
   - DEBUG-CHAPTER-LOADING.md: Full debugging guide

HOW TO USE:
-----------
1. Build & install the app:
   ./build-and-install.ps1

2. In a SEPARATE PowerShell window, run:
   ./view-logs.ps1

3. In the app:
   - Go to Verses → Browse
   - Add a new chapter (or use existing one)
   - Click the chapter to add it to progress
   - Go to "My Progress" tab

4. Watch the logs in the PowerShell window - they will tell us exactly what's 
   happening and where the problem is.

WHAT THE LOGS WILL SHOW:
-------------------------
- Whether the chapter exists in state when trying to add it
- What gets saved to storage
- Whether the chapter is found when displaying progress
- Any ID mismatches or missing data

WHY THIS APPROACH:
------------------
Instead of guessing and trying fixes blindly, we're using logging to see 
exactly what's happening at each step. This means we'll fix the actual 
problem on the FIRST try, not the 6th try.

The logs will clearly show:
✓ Where the chapter data exists
✗ Where it goes missing
→ What needs to be fixed

NEXT STEPS:
-----------
After you run the test, the logs will show us one of these scenarios:
1. Chapter not found when adding (state issue)
2. Chapter not found when displaying (storage/retrieval issue)  
3. Wrong flag set (isChapter not set correctly)

Then we can make the precise fix needed.
